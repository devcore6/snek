# Snek
Snake's stupid little cousin

## What even is this?
Basically just a bootable x86 snake game with integrated AI (kinda). AI will run automatically, you can use space to togle it on or off, WASD to control when the AI is off. Enter will respawn after you lose

## But like, why?
I don't know, I thought it was kinda funny, definitely was fun to make. It's also kind of oddly satisfying to watch.

## Okay so how do I run it?
Just download the ISO and make a virtual machine, I've tested it in virtual box but I see no reason why it wouldn't work on qemu, vmware or just about anything else. You can also just flash it on a thumb drive and boot into it.
